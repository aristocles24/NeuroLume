    "## Overview of the Neurolume Page Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The Neurolume page is assumed to be built with modern web technologies. Its structure includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Head Section:**\n",
    "   - Declares the document type and sets language and character encoding.\n",
    "   - Contains meta tags for viewport settings and responsiveness.\n",
    "   - Loads external resources (stylesheets, fonts, and JavaScript files) necessary for the page’s look and feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Internal/External CSS:**\n",
    "   - Applies a distinctive visual style that may include dark or neon-themed color palettes, smooth gradients, and animated transitions.\n",
    "   - Utilizes responsive design techniques to ensure the page renders well on all devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Body Section:**\n",
    "   - Typically features a **hero header** with a bold title (e.g., \"Neurolume\") and a brief tagline.\n",
    "   - Contains multiple **sections** (such as features, about, and footer) that describe the product, its capabilities, and background information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **JavaScript:**\n",
    "   - Manages interactive elements and animations.\n",
    "   - Initializes features when the document loads and may trigger effects such as dynamic backgrounds or interactive visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we explore each of these aspects in greater detail."

    "\n",
    "1. **Hero Header:**\n",
    "   - Displays a bold title and tagline that immediately inform the visitor of the page’s focus.\n",
    "   - Likely employs CSS animations and background effects to create an immersive visual experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Features Section:**\n",
    "   - Showcases major aspects of the Neurolume platform, such as \"Dynamic Illumination\" and \"Interactive Design.\" \n",
    "   - Each feature is described briefly and may include subtle animation effects when the user scrolls or hovers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **About Section:**\n",
    "   - Provides background information on the Neurolume concept, emphasizing its blend of neural interface technology and artistic design.\n",

    "The JavaScript embedded in the Neurolume page plays a crucial role in delivering an engaging user experience. Key functionalities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization on DOMContentLoaded:**\n",
    "  - When the document is ready, event listeners kick in to initialize animations and interactive components (e.g., animated backgrounds or hover effects).\n",

    "- **Console Logging for Debugging:**\n",
    "  - A simple `console.log` statement confirms that the page has loaded and that interactive features are being initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Potential for Further Expansion:**\n",
    "  - While the sample code shows a minimal setup, production code could include advanced techniques such as integration with WebGL/Three.js for 3D visualizations, parallax scrolling effects, or custom event handlers to respond to user input.\n",
